## This website

Journey, and destination.<br />
Process, and results.<br />
Documentations, and works.

Facts. Opinions.<br />
Feelings. Thoughts.<br />
Curation. Summary.<br />
Article. Essay.<br />
Portfolio. System.

Text, images, video,<br />
sound, interactive applications.<br />
Whatever it is.

I'll post it here.

In all the subject areas I like, about<br />
life, psychology, philosophy, programming, websites, poetry, writing, drawing, journaling, AI, even games like yu-gi-oh, or mobile legends, or whatever else I'm into.

I put everything here.<br />
Everything that I make, and give to people, I'll put it here.

There's no limit,<br />
form, nor subject.<br />
That's what I like about websites.

A platform that accepts all kinds of media,<br />
all kinds of subjects,<br />
everything. I'm infinite.

And all my process, my journey,<br />
my results, my work,

can be seen here.

I hope it's useful.

## Who I am

I don't really know who I am either.

So far I haven't been able to box myself into a clear label. There are too many fields that interest me. Some might consider me an 'IT guy' because I studied IT, some might consider me a 'comic guy' because I've written comics,

But deep down, I don't know what to call myself.<br />
I'm halfway into everything. Not because I don't like it, but because I like everything.

There are even more of my interests that people don't know about.<br />
And probably, even more interests that I don't know about (?)

I also have a lot of ideas... a lot of thoughts and projects that are very... "unusual".<br />
Some I can't articulate yet,<br />
some I think are too weird to discuss.<br />
Some I don't think are worthwhile,<br />
And others, maybe they could change the world. But I'm afraid to bring them up.<br />
Who knows (?)

I don't know myself.<br />
Sometimes it feels scary,<br />
but sometimes

it feels liberating.

The unknown invites wonder,<br />
invites one to play,<br />
experiment,<br />
strive,

on an adventure,<br />
to find a "treasure"<br />
that no one knows what it contains.

Because no one has ever gotten it.

Because that "treasure" is just for me,<br />
the question that asks, what is my greatest potential?<br />
What does it look like? What kind? What field?

And there are other "treasures" are also waiting for you,<br />
that belongs only to you,<br />
that invites you to your adventure.

Who am I?<br />
I am infinite, and I am adventurous.

Let's Go.<br />
