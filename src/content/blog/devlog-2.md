## UI changes

I want this website to be a website that I like when I look at it, that I can be proud of, and that other people are also comfortable looking at. Because I plan to continue developing this website until it becomes its best form, so I have to like and be enthusiastic every time I look at it & want to post here.

So the biggest change now is in the appearance.

In addition, in the home view, I made the format look like a linktree view. Because I put this website in my instagram bio, and the linktree view is the most familiar to people.

I made the theme with Cyberpunk style. Basically, I just changed the font. I used the 'Rajdhani' font, which can be accessed on google fonts. I did a lot of reviewing, starting from the font size, thickness, spacing between letters, and spacing between lines. I had to make it pleasant to read, because if the font is used directly without adjusting it first, it becomes unpleasant to read.

## Other Changes

This website is basically just 2 collections with posts, and tags.
Initially I wanted to make another collection called 'projects', but it turned out that my skills were not up to it. So I put all my projects in Tags.

In addition, I want to make this blog bilingual. I put the English one in a different repository on github. Why English?

1. I want to practice writing, speaking, listening to English.
2. I want my content to be accessible & enjoyed by people all over the world.

This is a long story, and I will discuss it in the next post.

In essence, the changes now are small changes, which at least I can still do, but the impact is rather significant. Modest, but still a significant improvement.

## Confide in the Process

I feel there is a difference between working on this website and working on comic stories. The brain activity is different.

When I work on a website, I can immediately work quite quickly and rarely get stuck. It almost reached automation. Meanwhile, when writing comic stories (Brandal) I often get stuck and have to try to be more creative. At first I thought this was the difference between the creative field and the more technical field. But I had other thoughts.

When I told my brother about this, he said it's not like that. Coding is not just a logical skill, and writing is not just a creative skill. So here it is.

To reach a level where we feel a sense of automation when we're working on something, someone must already have a skill there. So when he's working, he's not just learning, it's like he's already mastered all the fundamental skills.

So when working and encountering a problem, someone can quickly find a solution. Because he has already solved other problems that are one level below. So to solve the problem, he already has provisions. There is already a foundation and experience. Only then can that person reach the level of automation.

When I code, I rarely feel stuck because I've done this before. I've done websites before. Now, it could be that if I get stuck coding, it's because I don't have a foundation there yet. And I realized that there was also a dead-end phenomenon that I experienced when coding. For example, when I wanted to explore Astro & Tailwind, I only used quick solutions that had good results. As a result, the website was finished, but it was rough, and my coding was sloppy.

I didn't have the foundation knowledge in Astro, Tailwind, and Neat Coding.

It was also the same when I wrote Brandal, my first time writing in comic format. So I worked on it while learning the foundations.

That's what makes us feel stuck at times: we're actually working and learning at the same time.

I think now, the optimum is that we should learn the foundation first, then work on it. Because that way, when we work, we can achieve many targets. Automatically. And more productive.

When we learn too, we can experiment a lot of things, without the expectation that "this has to have results".

That's what I learned yesterday.

Okay that's all, hopefully it's useful :D
