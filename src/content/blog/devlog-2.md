## Perubahan UI

Aku mau website ini jadi website yang aku suka ketika aku lihat, bisa aku banggakan, dan orang lain juga nyaman lihatnya. Karena rencananya website ini pingin aku develop terus sampai nanti jadi wujud terbaiknya, jadi aku harus suka dan antusias setiap kali lihat & mau post di sini.

Jadi perubahan terbesar sekarang adalah di penampilan.

Selain itu, di tampilan home, aku buat formatnya kayak tampilan linktree. Karena website ini aku taruh di bio instagram, dan tampilan linktree yang paling familiar sama orang-orang.

Tema tampilannya aku bikin dengan style Cyberpunk. Pada intinya cuma ganti font. Aku pakai font 'Rajdhani', yang bisa diakses di google font. Banyak yang aku ulik, mulai dari ukuran font, tebelnya, jarak antar huruf, sama jarak antar baris. Aku harus bikin itu jadi enak dibaca, karena font itu kalau langsung dipakai tanpa diatur dulu, jadi nggak enak dibacanya.

## Perubahan Lain

Website ini pada intinya cuma 2 _collection_, ada post, dan ada tag.<br/>
Awalnya mau aku bikin ada _collection_ project, tapi ternyata kemampuanku belum sampai untuk itu. Jadi semua project aku taruh di Tag.

Selain itu, aku mau bikin blog ini jadi 2 bahasa. I put the English one in a different repository on github. Why English?

1. I want to practice writing, speaking, listening to English.
2. I want my content to be accessible & enjoyed by people all over the world.

This is a long story, and I will discuss it in the next post.

In essence, the changes now are small changes, which at least I can still do, but the impact is rather significant. Modest, but still a significant improvement.

## Confide in the Process

I feel there is a difference between working on this website and working on comic stories. The brain activity is different.

When I work on a website, I can immediately work quite quickly and rarely get stuck. It almost reached automation. Meanwhile, when writing comic stories (Brandal) I often get stuck and have to try to be more creative. At first I thought this was the difference between the creative field and the more technical field. But I had other thoughts.

When I told my brother about this, he said it's not like that. Coding is not just a logical skill, and writing is not just a creative skill. So here it is.

To reach a level where we feel a sense of automation when we're working on something, someone must already have a skill there. So when he's working, he's not just learning, it's like he's already mastered all the fundamental skills.

So when working and encountering a problem, someone can quickly find a solution. Because he has already solved other problems that are one level below. So to solve the problem, he already has provisions. There is already a foundation and experience. Only then can that person reach the level of automation.

When I code, I rarely feel stuck because I've done this before. I've done websites before. Now, it could be that if I get stuck coding, it's because I don't have a foundation there yet. And I realized that there was also a dead-end phenomenon that I experienced when coding. For example, when I wanted to explore Astro & Tailwind, I only used quick solutions that had good results. As a result, the website was finished, but it was rough, and my coding was sloppy.

I didn't have the foundation knowledge in Astro, Tailwind, and Neat Coding.

It was also the same when I wrote Brandal, my first time writing in comic format. So I worked on it while learning the foundations.

That's what makes us feel stuck at times: we're actually working and learning at the same time.

I think now, the optimum is that we should learn the foundation first, then work on it. Because that way, when we work, we can achieve many targets. Automatically. And more productive.

When we learn too, we can experiment a lot of things, without the expectation that "this has to have results".

That's what I learned yesterday.

Okay that's all, hopefully it's useful :D
