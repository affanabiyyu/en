## Why

I'm tired of looking for a quick way to get something.
That's all I've ever done, and I always end up stuck in the middle of the road.
I kept moving from one path to another,
and finally stopped, because I couldn't see my greatest potential emerging there.

I want to go the furthest, even if it's not fast.

It's not that I'm only pursuing one field, it's the opposite.
I now believe that my greatest potential is not just in one field. Instead, it's in many fields. Because I can't be boxed into just one field, at least that's what I believe now, looking at what happened before. That theory is what I'm testing now.

There are many things that I want to try, and I want to achieve.
And it has to start from the basics,
The foundation, the first step of a long journey.

It's simple, it's what I'm good at, it's basic, it's the foundation of everything I want to try: writing.

I've been writing in my personal journal, for myself. This time I'm writing for people to read. So I have to make sure that it's good to read, and that there are benefits. That's what I want to practice.

Why is writing the foundation?

I want to be articulate in conveying my feelings & thoughts.
I want to document my journey, and the best way to do that right now is in the form of text, because it's what I'm best at (compared to speaking directly)
I want to be an expert in this field, I want to be able to write proper essays / books

## Goal

The current goal is to write 66 posts, about anything, on this blog. Long, short, it doesn't matter. Because they say it takes 66 days for an activity to become a habit.

## Strategy

- make time to write every day, even if it's for a while
- write down what you want to write about, so you don't have to think hard about what to write about

## Logs

All Daily-Log posts can be found in the [project-daily-log category](/en/tags/project-daily-log) on this website.
